`exampletestr` is for creating shells (skeletons) of `testthat` unit test files based on the examples in a package's documentation. When these tests are completed, they will ensure that the examples function correctly and form a valuable part of your unit test suite. I have often (but not always) found that I test my functions manually by making sure my examples work as intended, so why not use these as a basis for proper unit testing?

## Installation

You can install the released version of exampletestr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=exampletestr) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("exampletestr")
```

You can install the released version of exampletestr from [GitHub](https://github.com/rorynolan/exampletestr) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("rorynolan/exampletestr")
```


## How to use `exampletestr`

There are three ways to use `exampletestr` to make unit test shells based on function examples:

1. [One function at a time](https://rorynolan.github.io/exampletestr/articles/one-function-at-a-time.html).
1. [One `.R` file at a time](https://rorynolan.github.io/exampletestr/articles/one-file-at-a-time.html).
1. [A whole package all at once](https://rorynolan.github.io/exampletestr/articles/whole-package.html).

These three articles should be read in order to learn how the package works and how to use it.


## The Goal is NOT Fully Automated Unit Test Creation

I would like to stress that whilst unit testing should be automatic, the creation of these tests is a manual process, a manual check. This package is supposed to help you to _start_ making those tests. It is not supposed to create fully functioning tests automatically, nor can it help you to write every type of test you might want.
